## How It Works
1. **Job Setup**: HR administrators have the ability to define and set job requirements within the application. They can specify the skills, experience, education, and other qualifications needed for each job position.
2. **PDF Upload**: HR personnel can upload candidate resumes in PDF format.
3. **Text Extraction**: The PDF Parser component extracts the text content from the uploaded PDFs.
4. **Matching Algorithm**: The extracted candidate details are compared with the job requirements set by HR using a sophisticated matching algorithm tailored to each job position. This matching process is carried out on the backend (PHP) with the support of AI components.
5. **Compatibility Rating**: Each candidate is assigned a compatibility rating with the job they applied for based on the customized matching algorithm for that specific job.
6. **Ranked List**: The tool generates a ranked list of candidates in descending order of their compatibility with the job they applied for. HR professionals can easily identify the top candidates for each job opening.
